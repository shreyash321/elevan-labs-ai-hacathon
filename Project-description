VBCST is a voice-based customer support tool that can talk to customers on phone calls. It can be used to manage business queries and replace boring customer agents.

VBCST is powered by a large language model that has been trained on a massive dataset of customer conversations. This allows VBCST to understand customer queries and provide accurate and helpful responses. VBCST can also access metadata about the customer, such as their name, contact information, and purchase history. This information can be used to personalize the customer experience and provide more relevant support.

VBCST is a cost-effective way to improve customer support. It can be used to handle a large volume of calls, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex queries. VBCST can also be used to provide 24/7 support, which can be a valuable asset for businesses that operate in multiple time zones.

VBCST is easy to use. It can be integrated with existing customer support systems, and it does not require any special training. VBCST can be used by businesses of all sizes, and it is a cost-effective way to improve customer satisfaction.
